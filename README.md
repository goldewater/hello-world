# hello-world
This is my first-ever GitHub repository. Welcome, Brave New World!
What the Hell am I supposed to do with this Repository called hello-world!?
I am a born-journalist who has worked as an accountant and as a software developer in the past.
I'm making this change to the original text as a precursor to the tsunami of written rage that I'm about to unleash upon the local universe. Thank You!
